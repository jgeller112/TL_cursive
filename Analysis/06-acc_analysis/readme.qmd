# 06 – Accuracy Analysis

This directory contains the **statistical analysis of accuracy data**
from the lexical decision task.

All inferential accuracy results reported in the manuscript are generated
in this step.

---

## 📄 Files

### `06-acc_analysis.qmd`
Quarto document that performs accuracy analyses, including:

- Binomial mixed-effects modeling of response accuracy


All modeling decisions are documented directly in this file.

---

## 🔗 Input Data

- Reads accuracy-cleaned data from:
  - `Analysis/05-acc_preprocessing/data_cleaned/`

No raw or unprocessed accuracy data are used at this stage.

---

## 📊 Output

This step produces:

- Model summaries and tables
- Model-based estimates (e.g., marginal means)
- Figures used in the manuscript

Model objects (`*.rds`) are **not tracked** and must be regenerated by re-running
the analysis.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

- This step depends on completed accuracy preprocessing
- All inferential results can be regenerated by rendering the `.qmd`
- If model specifications change, this step should be re-run
