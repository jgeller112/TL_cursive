# 07 – Probe / Memory Preprocessing

This directory contains preprocessing steps applied to **probe (recognition / memory) data**

This step prepares probe responses for downstream memory analyses.

---

## 📄 Files

### `07-probe_memory_preprocessing.qmd`
Quarto document that performs preprocessing of probe / memory data, including:

- Selecting probe trials
- Coding memory responses (e.g., correct / incorrect)
- Applying trial- or participant-level exclusions (if applicable)
- Preparing variables for memory analysis

All preprocessing decisions are documented directly in this file.

---

## 🔗 Input Data

- Reads from the combined trial-level dataset produced earlier in the pipeline
  (e.g., `Analysis/01-Read_Data/Combined_Raw_Data/`)
- May also merge information from earlier preprocessing steps, if required

No raw Pavlovia files are modified at this stage.

---

## 📊 Output

This step produces a **probe-cleaned dataset** suitable for:

- Memory accuracy analyses
- Comparisons across script (print vs. cursive)
- Linking memory performance to RT or accuracy measures (if applicable)

Derived datasets are written to disk for transparency but can be regenerated
by re-running this step.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

- Raw data remain untouched
- All probe-specific transformations occur in this `.qmd`
- If probe inclusion criteria change, this step should be re-run
