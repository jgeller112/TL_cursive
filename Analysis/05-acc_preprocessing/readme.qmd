# 05 – Accuracy Preprocessing

This directory contains preprocessing steps applied to **accuracy data**
from the lexical decision task prior to statistical analysis.

Accuracy preprocessing is performed **after general data cleaning**
and **before accuracy modeling**.

---

## 📄 Files

### `05-acc-preprocessing.qmd`
Quarto document that performs preprocessing specific to accuracy analyses,
including:

- Selecting trials for accuracy analyses
- Coding responses as correct / incorrect
- Applying participant- or trial-level exclusions (if applicable)
- Preparing accuracy variables for modeling

All preprocessing decisions are documented directly in this file.

---

## 📁 Output

### `data_cleaned/`
This folder contains the **accuracy-cleaned dataset** produced by
`05-acc-preprocessing.qmd`.

- Files are derived from the combined trial-level dataset
- Each row corresponds to a **single trial**
- Accuracy variables are ready for statistical modeling

Downstream analyses (e.g., `06-acc_analysis/`) read from this directory.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

- Raw behavioral data are never modified
- All accuracy-specific transformations occur in `05-acc-preprocessing.qmd`
- If accuracy inclusion criteria change, this step should be re-run
