# 01 – Read & Combine Raw Data

This directory contains the first step of the analysis pipeline:
**reading, standardizing, and combining raw Pavlovia behavioral files**.

---

## 📄 Files

### `01-Read_Data.qmd`
Quarto document that:

- Reads all participant-level Pavlovia `.csv` files from `Raw_files/`
- Standardizes variable names and formats
- Merges behavioral data with stimulus metadata
- Writes a combined trial-level dataset to `Combined_Raw_Data/`

This file should be run **before all subsequent analysis steps**.

---

### `Word_Targets_Spreadsheet.csv`
Stimulus metadata file containing information about the word targets
(e.g., item identity, condition labels, confusability type).

This file is joined to the raw behavioral data during the read step.

---

## 📁 Output

### `Combined_Raw_Data/`
This folder contains the **combined, cleaned, trial-level dataset**
produced by `01-Read_Data.qmd`.

- One or more `.csv` files
- Each row corresponds to a **single trial**
- Downstream preprocessing and analyses read from this directory

Files in this folder are **derived data**, but are retained to make the
analysis pipeline explicit and modular.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

- Raw Pavlovia files in `Raw_files/` are **never modified**
- All transformations occur in `01-Read_Data.qmd`
- If raw data change, this step should be re-run
