# 03 – Reaction Time Preprocessing

This directory contains all preprocessing steps applied to **reaction time (RT) data**
prior to statistical modeling.

RT preprocessing occurs **after general data cleaning** and **before RT analysis**.

---

## 📄 Files

### `03-RT_preprocessing.qmd`
Quarto document that performs RT-specific preprocessing, including:

- Excluding incorrect trials (if applicable)
- Applying lower and upper RT bounds
- Removing extreme or implausible RTs
- Preparing RT variables for downstream modeling

All preprocessing decisions are documented directly in this file.

---

## 📁 Output

### `Cleaned_RT/`
This folder contains the **RT-cleaned dataset** produced by
`03-RT_preprocessing.qmd`.

- Files are derived from the combined trial-level dataset
- Each row corresponds to a **single trial**
- RTs in this folder are ready for modeling and visualization

Downstream analyses (e.g., `04-RT_analysis/`) read from this directory.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

- No raw data are modified at this stage
- All RT exclusions and transformations occur in `03-RT_preprocessing.qmd`
- If RT preprocessing criteria change, this step should be re-run
