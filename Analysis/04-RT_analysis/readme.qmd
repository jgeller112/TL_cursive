# 04 – Reaction Time Analysis

This directory contains the **statistical analysis of reaction time (RT) data**
following preprocessing.

All RT models and inferential results reported in the manuscript are generated
in this step.

---

## 📄 Files

### `04-RT_analysisqmd.qmd`
Quarto document that performs RT analyses, including:

- Distributional modeling of RTs (e.g., ex-Gaussian)s

All modeling decisions and priors (if applicable) are documented in this file.

---

## 🔗 Input Data

- Reads RT-cleaned data from:
  - `Analysis/03-RT_Preprocessing/Cleaned_RT/`

No raw or unprocessed RT data are used at this stage.

---

## 📊 Output

This step produces:

- Model summaries and tables
- Model-based estimates (e.g., marginal means)
- Figures used in the manuscript

Model objects (`*.rds`) are **not tracked** and must be regenerated by re-running
the analysis.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

- This step depends on completed RT preprocessing
- All inferential results can be regenerated by rendering the `.qmd`
- If model specifications change, this step should be re-run
